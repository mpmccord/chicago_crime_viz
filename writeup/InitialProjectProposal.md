# Summary

The goal of this project is to examine the crime rate in the City of
Chicago and its relationship with time and location (i.e. zip code and
neighborhood). Specifically, I will be visualizing a few key factors:

-   How has the crime rate changed over time from January 2001
    (beginning of data collection) to the most recent date?
-   How does the crime rate relate to some other variables:
    -   the neighborhood where the incident was reported
    -   the demographics of the neighborhood
    -   the population density of the neigborhood and/or Chicago
    -   the unemployment rate in Chicago (overall) and the specific
        neighborhood (if available)
-   How does the proportion of arrests depend on:
    -   the category of crime (included in the dataset)
    -   crime itself (focusing on the top 5 most and least common)
-   (stretch goal) Special focus on gender-related crimes (e.g. domestic
    violence, sexual assault, stalking, etc.)
    -   How do the arrests and other factors of these crimes compare
        with the overall arrests and other factors?
    -   (additional stretch goal) =&gt; more detailed exploration of
        some related crimes, include brief page on that as well

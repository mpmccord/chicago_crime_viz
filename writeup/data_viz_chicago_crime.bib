	abstract = {In recent years law enforcement have improved by taking better strategies, computer aided technology, efficient use of resource, etc. As a result of these over the couple of years there has been a steep decline in crime rate in the US (United States). Law enforcement have turned to data science for insights (ranging from reports, corrective analysis and behavior modelling). There has been an overall drop in crime rates in Chicago in recent years. In fact, these rates are at the lowest when compared to the previous decades. This paper uses the criminal dataset found at “data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2” to describe historical trends, insights, etc. in Chicago from 1965 to 2018 and not to assign any casual interpretation of the vanguards of crime rates during this period. Here K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification is used for training and crime predication. Discussions on future investigation can also be found. The proposed model has an accuracy of 83.2\%.},

Because of having many dimensions of crime data, it is difficult to mine the available information using off the shelf or statistical data analysis tools. Improving this process will aid the police as well as crime protection agencies to solve the crime rate in a faster period. Also, criminals can often be identified based on crime data. Data mining includes strategies for the convergence of machine learning and database frameworks. Using this concept, we can extract previously unknown useful information and their patterns of occurrence from unstructured data. The sole purpose of this paper is to give an idea of how data mining can be utilised by crime investigation agencies to discover relevant precautionary measures from prediction rates. Data sets are analysed by some supervised classification algorithms, namely decision tree, K-nearest neighbours (KNN), and random forest algorithms. Crime forecasting is done for frequently occurring crimes like robbery, assault, and theft. Specifically, the results indicate the superiority of the random forest algorithm in test accuracy.},

	abstract = {Recent studies exploiting city-level time series have shown that, around the world, several crimes declined after COVID-19 containment policies have been put in place. Using data at the community-level in Chicago, this work aims to advance our understanding on how public interventions affected criminal activities at a finer spatial scale. The analysis relies on a two-step methodology. First, it estimates the community-wise causal impact of social distancing and shelter-in-place policies adopted in Chicago via Structural Bayesian Time-Series across four crime categories (i.e., burglary, assault, narcotics-related offenses, and robbery). Once the models detected the direction, magnitude and significance of the trend changes, Firth’s Logistic Regression is used to investigate the factors associated to the statistically significant crime reduction found in the first step of the analyses. Statistical results first show that changes in crime trends differ across communities and crime types. This suggests that beyond the results of aggregate models lies a complex picture characterized by diverging patterns. Second, regression models provide mixed findings regarding the correlates associated with significant crime reduction: several relations have opposite directions across crimes with population being the only factor that is stably and positively associated with significant crime reduction.},

In recent years, criminal justice agencies headed for Deep Learning, Data Mining, and Machine Learning (ML) to help in the crime-fighting process by taking advantage of historical crime data in order to identify and detect crime patterns and hotspots, predict crime occurrences in the future, and apprehend criminals and suspects. A major challenge facing researchers and law enforcement agencies is the rapid volume growth of crime data and how it can be analyzed accurately and efficiently. In this paper, state-of-the-art big crime data analysis and visualization have been done on two real crime datasets of two US cities, Chicago and San-Francisco.

Current crime prediction methods are trained using observed crime and information describing various criminogenic factors. Researchers have favored global models (e.g., of entire cities) due to a lack of observations at finer resolutions (e.g., ZIP codes). These global models and their assumptions are at odds with evidence that the relationship between crime and criminogenic factors is not homogeneous across space. In response to this gap, we present area-specific crime prediction models based on hierarchical and multi-task statistical learning. Our models mitigate sparseness by sharing information across ZIP codes, yet they retain the advantages of localized models in addressing non-homogeneous crime patterns. Out-of-sample testing on real crime data indicates predictive advantages over multiple state-of-the-art global models.},

Using publicly available data, we calculated percent tree canopy, percent acreage parks, and crime rate for assault, battery, burglary, homicide, narcotics, and robbery between years 2009–2013 for each of Chicago’s 801 census tracts. We used general linear modeling to determine whether tree canopy and crime rates as well as park area and crime rates were correlated after accounting for socioeconomic variables and spatial autocorrelation. An inverse association was found between percent tree canopy and crime rates for assault, battery, robbery, and narcotics. No significant association was found between crime types analyzed, with the exception of burglary, and percent park acreage.},

However, hotspot maps are often created over a single timescale using only one crime type. In the case of short-term hotspot maps that utilize several weeks of crime data, risk estimates suffer from a high variance, especially for low frequency crimes such as homicide. Long-term hotspot maps that utilize several years of data fail to take into account near-repeat effects and emerging hotspot trends. In this paper we show how point process models of crime can be extended to include leading indicator crime types, while capturing both short-term and long-term patterns of risk, through a marked point process approach. Several years of data and many different crime types are systematically combined to yield accurate hotspot maps that can be used for the purpose of predictive policing of gun-related crime. We apply the methodology to a large, open source data set which has been made available to the general public online by the Chicago Police Department.},

We investigate the use of spatiotemporally tagged Twitter posts for inferring micro-level movement patterns, and we use real crime data to develop and test a model informed by such patterns.

	abstract = {Introduction
Violence remains a priority issue in the United States (US) requiring public health input to discern the magnitude and impact of violence on the health system. Concerns over violence and the injuries resulting from violence have increased following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic which exacerbated an array of individual and economic stressors related to violence including increased unemployment, alcohol intake, social isolation, anxiety and panic and decreased access to health services. The aim of this study was to analyze the trends in violence-related injuries in the state of Illinois during the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown periods and post-lockdown in order to inform future public health policy.
Material and methods
Outpatient and inpatient assault related injuries treated in Illinois hospitals from 2016 through March 2022 were analyzed. Segmented regression models evaluating change in time trends were adjusted for seasonality, serial correlation, overall trend and economic variables.
Results
The annual rate of assault related hospitalizations per one million Illinois residents decreased from 3857.8 pre-pandemic to 3458.7 pandemic period. However, during the pandemic there was an increase in deaths and in the proportion of injuries involving open wounds, internal injuries, and fractures, while there was a reduction in less serious injuries. Segmented regression time series models demonstrated significant increase in firearm violence in all four pandemic periods examined. Firearm violence increased particularly in subgroups including African-American victims, 15–34-year-olds, and Chicago residents.
Conclusion
During SARS-CoV-2, we saw an overall reduction in assault related hospitalization, however, findings demonstrated an increase in serious injuries which may be associated with social and economic stressors of the pandemic, increased gun-violence while decrease in less serious injuries may be linked to hospital avoidance for non-lethal injuries during the peak waves of the pandemic. Our findings have implications for ongoing surveillance, service planning and management of the increased gunshot and penetrating assault cases and further demonstrate the need for public health input into the violence epidemic in the US.},

	abstract = {Opioid overdose is a growing public health crisis in the United States. This crisis, recognized as "opioid epidemic," has widespread societal consequences including the degradation of health, and the increase in crime rates and family problems. To improve the overdose surveillance and to identify the areas in need of prevention effort, in this work, we focus on forecasting opioid overdose using real-time crime dynamics. Previous work identified various types of links between opioid use and criminal activities, such as financial motives and common causes. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel spatio-temporal predictive model for opioid overdose forecasting by leveraging the spatio-temporal patterns of crime incidents. Our proposed model incorporates multi-head attentional networks to learn different representation subspaces of features. Such deep learning architecture, called "community-attentive" networks, allows the prediction of a given location to be optimized by a mixture of groups (i.e., communities) of regions. In addition, our proposed model allows for interpreting what features, from what communities, have more contributions to predicting local incidents as well as how these communities are captured through forecasting. Our results on two real-world overdose datasets indicate that our model achieves superior forecasting performance and provides meaningful interpretations in terms of spatio-temporal relationships between the dynamics of crime and that of opioid overdose.},

Our analysis bridges these three literatures and examines whether a neighborhood's historical and contemporary complaints about police mistreatment are a significant source of police stops. Our research focuses on complaints and stops in Chicago. We find that stops are more frequent in neighborhoods where historical and contemporary complaints are high, as well as in communities with high concentrations of economically disadvantaged, Hispanic, and especially Black residents. We find that these associations hold net of potential sources of spuriousness, including prior police stops and crime. Police perceptions of the race of the person stopped contextualize the relationships between stops and complaints: they are exacerbated for people the police identified as Black. Our findings suggest that complaints and the narratives they engender may be enduring systemic sources of bias in police behavior.},

	abstract = {This article develops and assesses the concept of triple neighborhood disadvantage. We argue that a neighborhood?s well-being depends not only on its own socioeconomic conditions but also on the conditions of neighborhoods its residents visit and are visited by, connections that form through networks of everyday urban mobility. We construct measures of mobility-based disadvantage using geocoded patterns of movement estimated from hundreds of millions of tweets sent by nearly 400,000 Twitter users over 18 months. Analyzing nearly 32,000 neighborhoods and 9,700 homicides in 37 of the largest U.S. cities, we show that neighborhood triple disadvantage independently predicts homicides, adjusting for traditional neighborhood correlates of violence, spatial proximity to disadvantage, prior homicides, and city fixed effects. Not only is triple disadvantage a stronger predictor than traditional measures, it accounts for a sizable portion of the association between residential neighborhood disadvantage and homicides. In turn, potential mechanisms such as neighborhood drug activity, interpersonal friction, and gun crime prevalence account for much of the association between triple disadvantage and homicides. These findings implicate structural mobility patterns as an important source of triple (dis)advantage for neighborhoods and have implications for a broad range of phenomena beyond crime, including community capacity, gentrification, transmission in a pandemic, and racial inequality.},

We conduct a synthetic control analysis for a comparative case study of impact of bail reform. We focus on synthetic control analysis of post-intervention changes in crime for assault, theft, burglary, robbery, and drug crimes, constructing a dataset from publicly reported crime data of 27 large municipalities. Our findings, including placebo checks and other robustness checks, show that for assault, theft, and drug crimes, there is no significant impact of bail reform on crime; for burglary and robbery, we similarly have null findings but the synthetic control is also more variable so these are deemed less conclusive.},

	abstract = {The effect of the Adapted-Coping with Stress (A-CWS) intervention on social support coping was examined, using a randomized controlled trial design. The participants were 410 ninth-grade students (ages 14 to 16 years and mostly African American) living in low-resourced neighborhoods. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to either the A-CWS intervention or a standard care control condition. All participants were assessed at their schools before implementation of the intervention, at intervention completion, and again at 6- and 12-month post-intervention. Engagement in social support coping was examined in both intention-to-treat and treatment-as-received samples (i.e., intervention participants who attended at least 12 A-CWS treatment sessions and participants in the standard care control condition), using latent growth models. In intentionto-treat analyses, no significant treatment effects were identified. In treatment-as-received analyses, results revealed a significant association between social support coping and treatment condition; levels of social support coping decreased over time in the control condition, but they remained relatively stable in the treatment condition. The results indicate adequate intervention adherence and efficacy of the A-CWS to sustain social support coping within a sample of youth at high risk for stress exposure and associated disorders.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the effects of the timing of nutritional aid disbursement on crime, using two main sources of variation: (a) a policy change in Illinois that substantially increased the number of SNAP distribution days and (b) an existing Indiana policy that issues SNAP beneﬁts by last name. We ﬁnd that staggering SNAP beneﬁts leads to large reductions in crime and theft at grocery stores by 17.5\% and 20.9\%, respectively. Findings also show that theft decreases in the second and third weeks following receipt but increases in the last week of the beneﬁt cycle due to resource constraints.},

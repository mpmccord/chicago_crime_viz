# Visualizing the Chicago Crime Dataset

Hello, and welcome! The purpose of this repository is to visualize the Chicago Crime dataset.
Due to the size of the dataset (~8 million rows), the GitHub repository does not actually include the dataset, which can be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/about_data).

__Note__: There is a backend template that exists, and a frontend.
The backend (Flask) will be used for data processing and updating the data daily. As of now, the backend does nothing.

The frontend (React) code is found under the `frontend/` directory.

Here are instructions for running it locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

-  NodeJS (install [here](https://nodejs.org/en))
